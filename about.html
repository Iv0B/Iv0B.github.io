You will find different things like my portfolio, gear and contact! I will now tell something more about myself! </p>

            <p2>I am still on school, in year 10 to be exactly. I do economy and society, it’s really interesting. And I also follow informatics and a course for Cisco. I really like the subjects I have now. </p>

            <p2>So this site is made for informatics, it’s a project where you need to make a site in HTML5 and CSS3. I really like photography and so the link was made! I did take some time to make this site. But now it’s finished! </p>

            <p2>*Sarcasm mode activated* So as I already told I live in the beautiful Netherlands. *Sarcasm deactivated*. No, it isn’t that bad. It’s really flat however and the weather is never really good. But we have money and stuff. So here you can photograph dikes and polders. And some windmills. You need to like it I guess. Weirdly enough I never photographed windmills but I have some drone shots from polders!</p>
